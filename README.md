# Overview
This project implements an Automatic License Plate Recognition (**ALPR**) system using Python. The goal is to automatically detect and recognize vehicle license plates from images.

# Features
* License plate detection using OpenCV.
* Character and digit extraction with Pytesseract.
* Based on the YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection framework.
* Web application for automated recognition.

# Results
The trained neural network achieves an accuracy of 90-95% in recognizing license plates, even in low-resolution images.
